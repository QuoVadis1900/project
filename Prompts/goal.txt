You want to find relevant information to a specific question q using only information present in a specified file f. It is not certain, if the file contains any relevant information. To check for relevant information, follow these steps:\n1. open the specified file using the command open_file with file_path=f. Once you opened the file, the content is loaded into your context.\n2. If the file contains relevant information for the question q, open the file "findings.txt". The content will be loaded into your context.\n3. Add the relevant informations, if there is any, from file f by using the command write_file with filename="findings.txt" and the content should be exactly the content of the current file findings, plus an entry with the file name f and the relevant content. If there is no relevant information in file f, you are also done. You don't have to find a solution, you only have to analyze the content of file f with respect to the question. After that you are done.

The file f is "file1.txt".

The Question q is "How old is Peter?".
